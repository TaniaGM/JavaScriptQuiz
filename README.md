# JavaScriptQuiz
Creating a JavaScript quiz that will test the user's JavaScript knowledge

Creating a quiz that will:
- be timed;
- time will be decreased if user inputs the wrong answer;
- when time runs out - either by user inputting wrong answers or by time running out 
- the quiz ends after all questions are answered, the user can input their name and add their score to the scoreboard
- timer is set for 30 seconds and the penalty for a wrong answer is a 5 second penalty deduction
- questions will be based on coding, rather than the amazing hockey one I had in mind.
